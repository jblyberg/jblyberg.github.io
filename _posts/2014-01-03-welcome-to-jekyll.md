This is a stub post. I'm going to come back and elaborate.

I've decided that at this point in my life, my [old blog][blyberg-net] will sit on ice and I'm going to write over here. I'm ditching Wordpress for Jekyll and [Github Pages][github-pages].  It's much more in-line with the way I work and there is something very liberating about being able to write in [markdown][redcarpet].  I guess I need the simplicity of the text file and command line in my life right now.  Also, this format allows me to break all the rules and conventions of blogging at my whim, which is very nice indeed.

More later.
